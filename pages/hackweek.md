[The hackweek model](http://www.pnas.org/content/115/36/8872.short) has emerged within the data
science community as a powerful tool for fostering exchange of ideas in research and computation by providing training in modern data analysis workflows. In contrast to conventional academic conferences
or workshops, hackweeks are intensive and interactive, facilitated by three core
components: tutorials on state-of-the-art methodology, peer-learning, and on-site
project work in a collaborative environment. This setup is particularly powerful for
sciences that require not only domain-specific knowledge, but also effective computational
workflows to foster rapid exchange of ideas and make discovery, as has been shown by
the success of the previous [geohackweeks](https://geohackweek.github.io). This is an excellent match
with the nature of satellite remote sensing where data are large and complex and the
community is diverse and collaborative.
