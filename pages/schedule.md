* Inform about instrument/algorithm strength and limitations 
* Introduce algorithms and associated data products (Land Ice/Sea Ice/Ocean only) 
* Familiarize users with data discovery and search 
* Build community between Science Team, Data Centers, Users 
* Introduce and share tools already developed 
* Identify gaps in tools, data format understanding and potential actions to fill those gaps 
* Test drive data access mechanisms and APIs 
* Generate community based tools (e.g. Python Libraries)
