title: Information for Applicants
description: To best benefit from the program, participants are expected to have some experience with programming and with analysis of remote sensing data. Although tutorials will focus on Python, much of the information and concepts extend to other languages (e.g., Matlab, R, IDL, Java), so even with no Python knowledge the tutorials will help educate the attendee in the basics of retrieving and applying ICESAT 2 data. For those who do not know Python or wish to improve their skills, we are organizing a software carpentry workshop Feb. 7-8, 2019 on the University of Washington campus. We will also provide guidance to participants who wish to learn Python through self-guided study.
