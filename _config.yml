title: Cryospheric Science with ICESat-2 Hackweek 2020
email: icesat@uw.edu
description: We have decided not to offer this hackweek in person because of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak. <br>
             Our team is exploring offering a remote hackweek. <br>
             This may include preliminary tutorials in May, followed by a 2-3 day virtual hack event the week of June 15, 2020. <br>
             We will continue to accept applications for this potential virtual hackweek until April 10, 2020. <br>
